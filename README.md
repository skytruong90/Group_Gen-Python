# Title: Group Generator Project
### This is a python program that can be used to generate groups of people after inputting the names of all the people grouping up.

## Here's how to use the program:

1. Run the program in a Python environment (e.g. IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, or terminal)
2. Enter a comma-separated list of names when prompted (e.g. "Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, Ellen")
3. Enter the desired group size when prompted (e.g. "2" for pairs or "3" for trios)
4. The program will generate and print random groups based on the input names and group size.

Note: This program assumes that the input names are all unique and that the number of names is divisible by the group size. If these assumptions do not hold, the program may not work as expected.

## What I have learned: 
1. How to hold a list of names within Python.
2. Generate the size of that list.
3. Practice coding with Python coding structure.
